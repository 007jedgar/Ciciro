# Agent instructions

## Merge conflicts

Resolve PR / branch conflicts by **rebasing** onto the base branch. Do not merge `main` (or `master`) into the feature branch to clear conflicts.

- `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main` (or the PR's base branch)
- Never `git rebase -i` (no interactive rebase)
- After each conflict: edit, `git add`, `git rebase --continue`
- Already-pushed branch: `git push --force-with-lease`
- Never force-push `main` / `master`
- If a rebase is in progress, finish or abort it — do not start a merge

## Code the phone shares

The Expo app cannot import from the Next app, so `src/lib/manuscript.ts` and `src/lib/suggestions.ts` have byte-for-byte copies in `apps/mobile/lib/`. Change both; `test/manuscript-parity.test.ts` and `test/suggestions-parity.test.ts` fail when they drift. Pending tracked changes live inline in chapter HTML; see `docs/tracked-changes.md`.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
